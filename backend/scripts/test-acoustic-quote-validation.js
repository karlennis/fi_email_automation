      Planning Application Reference: 2025/003
      
      The Planning Authority requires the applicant to submit an acoustic assessment 
      report for the proposed development. The noise assessment must address:
      
      1. Baseline noise monitoring results for the site
      2. Predicted noise levels during construction phase
      3. Operational noise from plant and equipment
      4. Mitigation measures to reduce sound levels
      
      The assessment should demonstrate compliance with relevant noise standards 
      including BS 4142 and demonstrate that noise levels will not exceed 55 dB(A) 
      at the nearest noise-sensitive receptors.
      
      Please submit this information within 4 weeks from the date of this request.
